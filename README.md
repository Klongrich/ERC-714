# ERC-714

New token standard for pre-sales held on the ethereum block-chain.

## How It Works

This standard is an extension of the ERC20 token standard. The current standard creates a token that is distributed instantly. Instead what an ERC714 token would do is  time-lock / lock a portion of the funds raised.

The first lock can be set to different percentages, however the standard is about 15.72% of ETH raised. This ETH is then sent instantly to Uniswap to provide liquidity for investors.

The second lock is on the ETH the team has raised. The time of payouts can be variable but the standard would be to pay out monthly. The contract would do so over the course of 6 months - 1 year depending on team size and funds raised.

Also note that all locks can be changed depending on team size, investor inputs, and amount raised.

## Use Case

The goal of this standard is to provide a more secure and trusted way of raising funds via a token sale on the ethereum block-chain. 

One of the main ways of adding trust would be to prevent rug pull scams. This is where a team raises money and instantly takes all of the funds and leaves. This potentially leads to investors being scammed out of millions of dollars. 

Another way of adding trust would be making it impossible for the team to dump all the ETH they have raised into their token after the pre-sale. This would allow them to not exit / crash the price of the token they are offering overnight. 

## Referral Structure

There will be referral fee structures that will allow additional coins to be paid out based on how many people use the referral code. Fee will start at 2.51% and grow depending on the amount raised from the referral. 

## UI-Fee

There will be a UI that will allow you to automate the creation of an ERC-714 token. However there will be a variable fee of 1% - 3% of funds raised, depending on volume, that will be paid out to our team. If you would not like to pay this fee, the ERC-714 standard is open source with a MIT license allowing anyone to use the code.
